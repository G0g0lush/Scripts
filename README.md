Hello there!

This Repository contains automated tasks that I develop for personal projects or during different courses that I follow.

Every script is commented so you can get a better idea what it does.
For the moment, there are automations developed in BASH and Ansible.

I currently have three directories:
  1. Monitoring - which contains a script that checks services
  2. WebApp - which contains scripts that deploy simple HTML webpages using different templates
  3. Ansible - contains a directory with an inventory and a playbook which are deploying a simple HTML page.
